# My Portfolio

I was asked to create a website to be my landing page for employers to look for my projects that I have completed.  This was to include links to sections of "About Me", "Work", and "Contact Me."  I was also to provide a link to any of the web pages I have completed.

## Getting Started

I started by reading through the homework requirements.  I then used a pen and a piece of paper to sketch out how I wanted my page to look.  I then figured out what I was going to say and where it needed to be located.  I used pictures from my iPhone for filler spots where my future projects will go.  I used an image off a Google search of computer code to represent the first boot camp project that I completed.  After many hours of searching, I was able to get the layout to work the way I wanted it to.  Then I was able to locate on Stack Overflow how to link the links at the top of my page to the sections they corresponded with and also how to link my picture with the actual website of my first project, because that was something I was having problems with.  Finally, I was able to launch my website.  For some reason the actual pictures are not working.  They included:
